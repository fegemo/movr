# Movr

An interactive demonstration of different kinematic and dynamic
movement algorithms.

## Roadmap

- ( ) Draw a grid in the background
- ( ) Allow setting an agent as target
- ( ) Differentiate (w/ color?) kinematic from dynamic agents
- ( ) Visual debugging information (vectors, radii)
- ( ) Play/pause/stop/step
- ( ) Allow putting circle obstacles
- ( ) Allow putting rectangular obstacles
- ( ) Allow putting polygonal obstacles?
